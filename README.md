# The Modified Table
Please have a look at my small script which I wrote in Vanilla JavaScript which generates table with data from the list of objects.

## Some functionality of the script:

* The form that allows you to edit all the table fields; 
* Boolean fields are interpreted as: Yes/No;
* When you click on the corresponding row of the table, the data from it is loaded into the form;
* After clicking the Save button, the data in the table is updated.
